## This is a heavy work in progress**
[Live](https://timbak94.github.io/WonVOne/) (**music is loud**)
## Controls
* A/D - left and right
* S - dash (move more quickly in whatever direction your are facing)
* J - jump
* K - attack

## Features
* You can wall slide while falling by holding the direction towards the wall while falling.
* You can jump 3 times before you hit the ground. This gets reset if you either get hit or you wall slide. 
* Successful hits on the boss are indicated by the yellow explosion. If there is only a green swing, you have not made contact with the enemy. 
* Successful hits allow you to regain health. 1 health regained per hit and 10 damage taken per enemy hit. 
* Upon reaching <50% health, the boss will use a super move. If you cannot dodge the super move, you are playing the game correctly. 

## To do 
1. Diversify projectiles
2. Add more sound effects/voices 
3. Create a start screen and end screen
4. Update visuals on health bar
5. Add a mute button
